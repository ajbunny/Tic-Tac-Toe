## Tic - Tac - Toe
For my first project ever, I decided to create the class Tic - Tac - Toe game. For me, this prjoect was about learning to apply of the the knowledge I have learned so far from my bootcamp into on simple game. 


## Motivation
Initally wanted to do a completely different game - Space Race. However, I quickly ( and quite humbly) learned that I had bitten on more than I could chew. While my instructors were extremely supportive and encouraging, being that this was my first project and I am farily new to programming, I decided to switch it to the classic Tic - Tac - Toe game. I decided that it would be better that I allow myself the time and practice to fully learn the basics when it comes to programming. I am very happy that I decided to switch my game because in the end, I truly believe it helped solidify the concepts that my instructors had taught me thus far. Also, as I further expand my knowlegde, I plan to comeback and update the game and build on my current code.

## Credits
I would like to thank my awesome instructor Kasper for helping me display my winning background colors to my game. I was struggling with how to display the colors, and I knew there was a simpler method I could use. Kasper saved the day and helped me realized 1) there is always more than 1 way to achieve something and 2) simple code is great code. 

I would also like to thank my classmate Richard for providing a line of code to help my restart button function properly. 

Major shout out to YouTuber Siphiwo Julayi! While I watched various vidoes on Youtube to create this project, it was his video that I found the most valuable in the sense that he broke everything down and helped me really understand why he did what he did.
